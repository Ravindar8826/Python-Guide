# Python-Guide
Here you will find you start with Python and How to the basic and intermediate level coding in Python. 
  
You can use google colab which you will find on google alternatively you can also use the Jupiter Notebook(Anconda) , the link is attached , you can dowload it from there.  
Type `print("Hello World")` # Output Hello World.   
  
There are types of variable such as `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`  
  
Example of these variable are: name = "Ravindar"  #string  
                               age = 25           # Integer   
                               height = 5.7       # Float    
                               is_student = True  # Boolean     
Basic Data Structure : List(Ordered, Mutuable), Tuple(Ordered, Immutable), Dictionaries(Key value pairs), Conditional Statements, Loops, Functions, Reading & Writing Files, Working with libraries, Exception Handling.  
Common libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

Python for Economist  
Python is widely used in economic research for data analysis, econometrics, machine learning, and visualization. Below is a structured guide covering everything an economics researcher should know.    
1. Setting up Python for research
2. Data Handling with Pandas; Importing and viewing of data, filtering and aggregation and Data cleaning.
3. Data Visulization for Economics: Line Chart(Time series data), Scatter Plot(Relationship between two variables), Histogram(Distribution).
4. Econometric in Python: Fixed effect in panel data model, Instrumental Variable(IV) regression, OLS regression, Logistic and probit regression.
5. Time series Analysis: Stationary Check(ADF Test), ARIMA Model, VAR Model
6. Working with Large dataset: Use dask for Large datasets, Optimize merging and fast merging
7. Web Scraping and API for Economic Data: Scrape economics data from websites andd Retrieve data from World Bank API
8. Machine learning in Economics: Linear regression (ML approach), Decision Tree and Random Forest, Monte Carlo Simulation for Forecasting
9. Dynamic Macro modelling

For modelling Normalize and Standardize the data
